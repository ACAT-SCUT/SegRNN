SegRNN is an innovative RNN-based model designed for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). It incorporates two fundamental
strategies:
1. The replacement of point-wise iterations with segment-wise iterations
2. The substitution of Recurrent Multi-step Forecasting (RMF) with Parallel Multi-step Forecasting (PMF)
